LED-Lux Project By Team 06  


##The project  

LED-Lux is smart lighting system designed to make your life better by changing the intensity and colors of the lights to fit what is biologically best for that time of day. To do this, there are 3 parts to the project. First, the node-mesh network of ZigBee controlled lights; second, the web app controlling the lights; and third, the machine vision core that tracks movement in the room. The sorce code will be stored here.
